# German ELECTRA base generator

Released, Oct 2020, this is the generator component of the German ELECTRA language model trained collaboratively by the makers of the original German BERT (aka "bert-base-german-cased") and the dbmdz BERT (aka bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased). In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10906.pdf), we outline the steps taken to train our model.

The generator is useful for performing masking experiments. If you are looking for a regular language model for embedding extraction, or downstream tasks like NER, classification or QA, please use deepset/gelectra-base.

## Overview  
**Paper:** [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10906.pdf)  
**Architecture:** ELECTRA base (generator)
**Language:** German
