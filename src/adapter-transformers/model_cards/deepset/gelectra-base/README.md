# German ELECTRA base

Released, Oct 2020, this is a German ELECTRA language model trained collaboratively by the makers of the original German BERT (aka "bert-base-german-cased") and the dbmdz BERT (aka bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased). In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10906.pdf), we outline the steps taken to train our model. Our evaluation suggests that this model is somewhat undertrained. For best performance from a base sized model, we recommend deepset/gbert-base

## Overview  
**Paper:** [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10906.pdf)  
**Architecture:** ELECTRA base (discriminator)
**Language:** German  

## Performance  
```
GermEval18 Coarse: 76.02
GermEval18 Fine:   42.22
GermEval14:        86.02
```
