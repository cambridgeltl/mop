# ELECTRA Tagalog Base Uncased Discriminator
Tagalog ELECTRA model pretrained with a large corpus scraped from the internet. This model is part of a larger research project. We open-source the model to allow greater usage within the Filipino NLP community.

This is the discriminator model, which is the main Transformer used for finetuning to downstream tasks. For generation, mask-filling, and retraining, refer to the Generator models.

## Usage
The model can be loaded and used in both PyTorch and TensorFlow through the HuggingFace Transformers package.

```python
from transformers import TFAutoModel, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# TensorFlow
model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained('jcblaise/electra-tagalog-base-uncased-discriminator', from_pt=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('jcblaise/electra-tagalog-base-uncased-discriminator', do_lower_case=False)

# PyTorch
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('jcblaise/electra-tagalog-base-uncased-discriminator')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('jcblaise/electra-tagalog-base-uncased-discriminator', do_lower_case=False)
```
Finetuning scripts and other utilities we use for our projects can be found in our centralized repository at https://github.com/jcblaisecruz02/Filipino-Text-Benchmarks
